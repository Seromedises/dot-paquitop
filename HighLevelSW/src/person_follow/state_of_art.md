# List of following person algorithm

## [Koide3](https://github.com/koide3/monocular_person_following)

This package provides a monocular vision-based person tracking and identification framework for the person following robots. It first detects people using tf-pose-estimation and then tracks them in the robot space with the Unscented Kalman filter with the ground plane information. The entire system is designed so that it can be run on a Jetson TX2/Xavier, and it can easily be reproduced and reused on a new mobile robot platform.
